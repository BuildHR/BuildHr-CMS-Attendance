# Attendance Device Integration with CMS Attendance

The goal of this CMS Attendance is to sync Bio-Metric Attendance data from databases to Contract Management System(CMS by BuildHr)

## Introduction

An attendance management tool is a positive strategy to magnify productivity in any organization. CMS Attendance offers attendance device integrations that aid in accurate attendance management.

You can integrate your attendance device with CMS Attendance by making use of APIs. In order to sync your device's attendance entries with your employee's attendance records in CMS, you need to have a common format between your device and your CMS Attendance account.

## Getting Started with Prerequisites

The biometric device with CMS is through the configuration of a plugin using **Python and ODBC drivers**.

Integration can be done with any of these databases: **MS SQL Server, MS Access and MY SQL**.

> _**Note:** The **data** from the biometric **should be automatically downloaded into the database**._

### Database Query Format

_Select employeeID, eventTime, isCheckin, downloadDate from Attendance_

- **employeeID** : Should be the same employee-id in CMS
- **eventTime** : Attendance In-punch and Out-punch
- **isCheckin** : 1/0 ( 1 denotes check-in and 0 denotes check-out)
- **downloadDate** : Date and Time at which the attendance data got pushed to database

> _**Note:** For **MS Access**, database should be available in the **local system**_
