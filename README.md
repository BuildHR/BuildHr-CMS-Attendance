# 'CMS Attendance' - Integration Middleware

The objective of this middleware is to sync attendance data from Bio-Metric device's database to Contract Management System (CMS by BuildHr)

## Introduction

An attendance management tool is a positive strategy to magnify productivity in any organization. 'CMS Attendance' offers attendance device integrations that aid in accurate attendance management.

You can integrate your attendance device with CMS Attendance by making use of APIs. In order to sync attendance entries of employees in CMS attendance, it is required to have certain pre-requisites captured in the bio-metric device's database.

## Getting Started with Pre-requisites

Integration between Bio-metric device's database & CMS Attendance  is achieved by configuration of a middleware using **Python and ODBC drivers**.

Using this middleware, CMS can be integrated with any of these databases: **MS SQL Server, MS Access and MY SQL**.

> _**Note:** The **data** from the biometric **should be automatically downloaded into the database**._

### Database Query Format

_Select employeeID, eventTime, isCheckin, downloadDate from Attendance_

- **employeeID** : Should be the same employee-id in CMS
- **eventTime** : Attendance In-punch and Out-punch
- **isCheckin** : 1/0 ( 1 denotes check-in and 0 denotes check-out)
- **downloadDate** : Date and Time at which the attendance data got pushed to database

> _**Note:** For **MS Access**, database should be available in the **local system**_
